# Portfolio-Optimisation
To investigate and explore Portfolio-Optimisation, I mined stock market data directly from Yahoo Finance into a CSV file using Python. Then I implemented a data warehouse to store the data in Microsoft SQL Server, using Visual Studio (SQL Server Integration Services) to import the CSV file into the staging area. I created a script to extract the data into the dimension and fact tables from the staging area and use Python, Tableau and Power BI to investigate and explore the effect of diversification on portfolios and different portfolio optimisation based on investors' risk profiles.
